## Project Overview  
The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted to improve student success rates on DMV driving tests. The client requested a system that would combine online coursework, practice exams, and on-the-road scheduling into a single browser-based platform.  

The system design enables customers, instructors, and administrators to access training materials, schedule lessons, and manage accounts securely. The proposed architecture uses a modern web application stack with a relational SQL database for managing user data, reservations, and DMV updates. The design includes multi-tiered role access (students, secretaries, instructors, IT staff, administrators) with secure authentication, encrypted communications (TLS), and account lockout policies for enhanced protection.

## What I Did Well  
I did particularly well translating user and business needs into actionable system requirements. The measurable goals—such as page load-time targets, automated reporting, and role-based dashboards—helped ensure the system met both user expectations and business objectives. I also implemented strong attention to security by including password hashing, HTTPS/TLS connections, and automatic DMV data synchronization to maintain compliance and reliability.

## What I Would Revise  
If I could revise one area, I would enhance the UML sequence and class diagrams to provide deeper visualization of how the database interacts with the user interface and background processes. Adding this level of technical detail would help developers and stakeholders better understand system dependencies and data flow throughout the application.

## Interpreting and Implementing User Needs  
My design approach was centered on understanding the customer journey—how each user type interacts with the system and what challenges they face. Students needed an easy way to book lessons and track progress, while administrators required data-driven dashboards and reporting. Mapping these user needs directly into functional and nonfunctional requirements ensured that every system feature supported a clear user goal.  

Considering user needs is essential when designing systems, as it ensures the solution is both technically effective and practically usable. A well-designed interface and logical workflow can determine whether a product succeeds or fails in real-world use.

## Approach to Software Design  
My process begins with gathering requirements and creating user stories, followed by visual modeling through UML diagrams and iterative feedback. I rely on clear documentation, structured version control in GitHub, and modular design principles to ensure flexibility and scalability.  

In future projects, I plan to continue using iterative design, stakeholder feedback loops, and agile methodologies to improve development efficiency and maintain alignment between technical design and business objectives.

Together, these documents demonstrate my ability to collect customer requirements, analyze problems, and design secure, efficient, and user-focused systems.
